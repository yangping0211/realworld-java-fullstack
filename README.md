# (Full Stack Java) RealWorld Example App

> ### Spring Boot codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that inspired by the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld).

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Spring Boot** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
